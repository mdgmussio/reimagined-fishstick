# The Git-astrophe Chronicles  
Welcome to our repo, where commits go to die and branches grow like weeds.  

## Rules  
1. Never `git push --force` (unless you hate us).  
2. Merge conflicts are solved with rock-paper-scissors.  
3. If it breaks, blame Bob.  

## Current Status  
- Code: 10% functional, 90% "why is this here?"  
- Team morale: Powered by coffee and despair.  

Happy coding, you glorious disasters!
